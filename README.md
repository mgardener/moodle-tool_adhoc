Adhoc task tool
==================

Adhoc task management interface for Moodle 2.7+.
This plugin allows you to manage failing adhoc tasks and to monitor/test adhoc tasks during development.
It also provides CLI utilities for running large batches of adhoc tasks at once to offload from cron, for example during annual rollover.
